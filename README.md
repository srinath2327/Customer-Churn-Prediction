# Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn using a supervised machine learning approach. The dataset used is from Kaggle: [Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshahidazeem/customer-churn-dataset), which contains customer demographic and usage data for a telecom company.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn occurs when existing customers stop doing business with a company. Reducing churn is crucial for business profitability. This project uses customer data to build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer will churn or not.
